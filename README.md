# SumoPositioningSystem
Positioningsystem for Sumo Robot

This repository is for a sumo positioning system. The positioningsystem consists of an Arduino Micro, a XBee and 2 sensors: 
Gyro (L3GD20H) and laser motion Sensor (ADNS-9800).
The repository consits of program for positioningsystem for sending position via I2C and a program to send position via XBee. 
Then also an example program in arduino to read from the positioning system via I2C with a library. Also program in C# to do live tracking 
of sumo robot. This gets its data via XBee. 

The Altium files for the PCB are also included and also .STL files for the casing.
